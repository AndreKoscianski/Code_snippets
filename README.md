# Code snippets

These are small code recipes, we may use here and there. Hopefully you'll find something useful.


**csv.hpp** : read and write csv - only basic functionality. Format = std::vector<std::vector<double>> = ReadCSV

**config_handler.hpp** : read values (int/double/bool/string) from a simple configuration file; see comments at the beginning of the .hpp).
