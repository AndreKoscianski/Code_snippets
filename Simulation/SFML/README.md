These files contain skeleton code for use with the [SFML library] (https://www.sfml-dev.org/).

Installation of the library varies according to your operating system.
Note that you need to install the "development" version of the library, which includes Header Files.

Each CPP file describes how to compile in Linux. Don't be sad, 'cause the library is pretty popular and you'll certainly find pages showing how to get it working on other O.S.
