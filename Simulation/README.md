# Simulation

Code in this directory originated from experiments, classes to be taught or simple questions I had concerning simulation.


**SFML/** : directory containing kick-start code to show cellular automata using [Simple and Fast Multimedia Library](http://www.sfml-dev.org).

**CVector2.hpp** : 2d vectors - only the basics. Example, CVector2 v1 = (v2 * (v3 * 3.0)) + v4 ;

**CBall.hpp** : a moveable circle 'template'; has velocity, detects collision, computes time to collide (with another ball or a line).

**WattsStrogatz.cpp** : creates a [Watts-Strogatz graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watts%E2%80%93Strogatz_model). Simple code, easy to adapt and re-use.
